# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis (Python + Power BI)

This project performs **customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** on a retail / e-commerce style dataset.  
It combines **Python** for data preparation & RFM scoring and **Power BI** for interactive visualisation.

---

## Objectives

- Segment customers based on their purchase behaviour  
- Identify high-value and at-risk customer groups  
- Provide an interpretable framework for targeted marketing and retention  
- Demonstrate a hybrid workflow: Python for analytics + Power BI for BI dashboards  

---

## RFM Definition

- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency (F):** How often a customer buys  
- **Monetary (M):** How much revenue the customer generates  

RFM scores are combined into segments (e.g. *Champions, Loyal, At Risk, Lost*).

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Power BI  
- (Optional) Matplotlib / Seaborn for plots
